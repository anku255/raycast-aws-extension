## Windsor Raycast AWS

This is a fork of the [Raycast AWS Plugin](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/amazon-aws). The orignal extension is maintained by a 3rd party developer so there was a risk of them stealing our AWS credentials. For this reason, we forked the extension and will maintain it ourselves.

## Installation

1. Install [Raycast](https://raycast.com)
2. Join the [windsor-aws](https://www.raycast.com/invite/4aac9be3) organization
3. Install the Amazon AWS from the `windsor-aws` organization store

## Features

- Find and open resources (e.g. S3 Bucket, EC2 Instance, DynamoDB Table, CloudWatch Log Group, Parameter Store, Secrets Manager)
- Shortcut repetitive workflows (e.g. purge SQS queue, download S3 object, copy SSM parameter, copy Secret Manager secret)
- Zero configuration required
- Quick access to Lambda Logs
